# Vilna Troupe D3.js

The Vilna Troupe was an influential and highly successful travelling theatre troupe in the early to mid 20th century. Performing in Yiddish, they spread across the globe, forming splinter groups that furthered their reach. The intention is to illustrate the path of these troupes over time, and how much of a global reach and influence they had on world theater.

Data was collected by Debra Caplan from extensive archival research, and converted into GeoJSON format.

Utilizing D3.js, the theater's travelling paths are charted on a manipulateable globe, each arc representing a jump from one performance venue to the next. 

Current Goals:
- fill out any missing gis data
- distinguish each troupe by color-coding
- filter display parameters by date, troupe 
- allow zooming of globe

Future Goals:
- create animation of group travel over time, or hop-scotching with one troupe around the globe.
- display extensive metadata, such as plays, performance venues, statistics etc.
